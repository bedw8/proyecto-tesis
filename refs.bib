	doi = {10.1103/physreve.72.027104},
	abstract = {The description of the structure of complex networks has been one of the focus of attention of the physicist’s community in the recent years. The levels of description range from the microscopic (degree, clustering coefficient, centrality measures, etc., of individual nodes) to the macroscopic description in terms of statistical properties of the whole network (degree distribution, total clustering coefficient, degree-degree correlations, etc.) [1, 2, 3, 4]. Between these two extremes there is a ”mesoscopic” description of networks that tries to explain its community structure. The general notion of community structure in complex networks was first pointed out in the physics literature by Girvan and Newman [5], and refers to the fact that nodes in many real networks appear to group in subgraphs in which the density of internal connections is larger than the connections with the rest of nodes in the network. The community structure has been empirically found in many real technological, biological and social networks [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and its emergence seems to be at the heart of the network formation process [11]. The existing methods intended to devise the community structure in complex networks have been recently reviewed in [10]. All these methods require a definition of community that imposes the limit up to which a group should be considered a community. However, the concept of community itself is qualitative: nodes must be more connected within its community than with the rest of the network, and its quantification is still a subject of debate. Some quantitative definitions that came from sociology have been used in recent studies [12], but in general, the physics community has widely accepted a recent measure for the community structure based on the concept of modularity Q introduced by Newman and Girvan [13]:},

	doi = {10.1109/tcss.2014.2307458},
	abstract = {In this paper, we first discuss the definition of modularity (  \$\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\$   ) used as a metric for community quality and then we review the modularity maximization approaches which were used for community detection in the last decade. Then, we discuss two opposite yet coexisting problems of modularity optimization; in some cases, it tends to favor small communities over large ones while in others, large communities over small ones (so-called the resolution limit problem). Next, we overview several community quality metrics proposed to solve the resolution limit problem and discuss Modularity Density (  \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$   ), which simultaneously avoids the two problems of modularity. Finally, we introduce two novel fine-tuned community detection algorithms that iteratively attempt to improve the community quality measurements by splitting and merging the given network community structure. The first one, referred to as Fine-tuned   \$\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\$   , is based on modularity (  \$\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\$   ), while the second is based on Modularity Density (  \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$   ) and denoted as Fine-tuned   \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$   . Then, we compare the greedy algorithm of modularity maximization (denoted as Greedy   \$\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\$   ), Fine-tuned   \$\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\$   , and Fine-tuned   \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$    on four real networks, and also on the classical clique network and the {LFR} benchmark networks, each of which is instantiated by a wide range of parameters. The results indicate that Fine-tuned   \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$    is the most effective among the three algorithms discussed. Moreover, we show that Fine-tuned   \$\{\{{\textbackslash}mbi\{Q\}\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}bf ds\}\}\}\$    can be applied to the communities detected by other algorithms to significantly improve their results.},

We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

Mech. 10 10008) is one of the most widely used methods because of its good performance, especially in the big data era. In this paper we make some improvements to this algorithm in correctness and performance. By tests we see that different node orders bring different performances and different community structures. We find some node swings in different communities that influence the performance. So we design some strategies on the sweeping order of node to reduce the computing cost made by repetition swing. We introduce a new concept of overlapping degree ({OV}) that shows the strength of connection between nodes. Three improvement strategies are proposed that are based on constant {OV}, adaptive {OV}, and adaptive weighted {OV}, respectively. Experiments on synthetic datasets and real datasets are made, showing that our improved strategies can improve the performance and correctness.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times.

We show that party influence on Congressional blocs varies widely throughout history, and that existing measures underestimate polarization in periods with weak party structures. We demonstrate that modularity is a significant predictor of changes in majority party and that turnover is more prevalent at medium levels of modularity. We show that two variables related to modularity, called `divisiveness' and `solidarity,' are significant predictors of reelection success for individual House members. Our results suggest that modularity can serve as an early warning of changing group dynamics, which are reflected only later by changes in party labels.},

Many real-world networks are sparse and hierarchical, with m {\textasciitilde} n and d {\textasciitilde} log n, in which case our algorithm runs in essentially linear time, O(n log{\textasciicircum}2 n). As an example of the application of this algorithm we use it to analyze a network of items for sale on the web-site of a large online retailer, items in the network being linked if they are frequently purchased by the same buyer. The network has more than 400,000 vertices and 2 million edges.

I apply the Stochastic Degree Sequence Model to data on bill co-sponsorship in both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate, from 1973 (93rd session) to 2016 (114th session) to infer a series of signed networks of political relationships among legislators, which I then use to answer two research questions. First, can the widely reported finding of increasing weak polarization in the U.S. Congress be replicated when using a statistical model to make inferences about when positive political relations exist? Second, is the (increasing) polarization observed in the U.S. Congress only weak polarization, or is it strong polarization? I find that both chambers exhibit both weak and strong polarization, that both forms are increasing, and that they are structured by political party affiliation.

	abstract = {The emergence of order in natural systems is a constant source of inspiration for both physical and biological sciences. While the spatial order characterizing for example the crystals has been the basis of many advances in contemporary physics, most complex systems in nature do not offer such high degree of order. Many of these systems form complex networks whose nodes are the elements of the system and edges represent the interactions between them. 
Traditionally complex networks have been described by the random graph theory founded in 1959 by Paul Erdohs and Alfred Renyi. One of the defining features of random graphs is that they are statistically homogeneous, and their degree distribution (characterizing the spread in the number of edges starting from a node) is a Poisson distribution. In contrast, recent empirical studies, including the work of our group, indicate that the topology of real networks is much richer than that of random graphs. In particular, the degree distribution of real networks is a power-law, indicating a heterogeneous topology in which the majority of the nodes have a small degree, but there is a significant fraction of highly connected nodes that play an important role in the connectivity of the network. 
The scale-free topology of real networks has very important consequences on their functioning. For example, we have discovered that scale-free networks are extremely resilient to the random disruption of their nodes. On the other hand, the selective removal of the nodes with highest degree induces a rapid breakdown of the network to isolated subparts that cannot communicate with each other. 
The non-trivial scaling of the degree distribution of real networks is also an indication of their assembly and evolution. Indeed, our modeling studies have shown us that there are general principles governing the evolution of networks. Most networks start from a small seed and grow by the addition of new nodes which attach to the nodes already in the system. This process obeys preferential attachment: the new nodes are more likely to connect to nodes with already high degree. We have proposed a simple model based on these two principles wich was able to reproduce the power-law degree distribution of real networks. Perhaps even more importantly, this model paved the way to a new paradigm of network modeling, trying to capture the evolution of networks, not just their static topology.},

	abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods, we derive the phase diagram of the system and estimates of the expected final numbers of individuals infected with each disease. The system shows an unusual dynamical transition between dominance of one disease and dominance of the other as a function of their relative rates of growth. Close to this transition the final outcomes show strong dependence on stochastic fluctuations in the early stages of growth, dependence that decreases with increasing network size, but does so sufficiently slowly as still to be easily visible in systems with millions or billions of individuals. In most regions of the phase diagram we find that one disease eventually dominates while the other reaches only a vanishing fraction of the network, but the system also displays a significant coexistence regime in which both diseases reach epidemic proportions and infect an extensive fraction of the network.},

This paper focuses on the quantitative characterization of substorm dynamics captured by ground-based magnetometer stations. We present the first analysis of substorms using dynamical networks obtained from the full available set of ground-based magnetometer observations in the Northern Hemisphere. The stations are connected in the network when the correlation between the vector magnetometer time series from pairs of stations within a running time window exceeds a threshold. Dimensionless parameters can then be obtained that characterize the network and by extension, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the substorm under observation. We analyze four isolated substorm test cases as well as a steady magnetic convection ({SMC}) event and a day in which no substorms occur. These test case substorms are found to give a consistent characteristic network response at onset in terms of their spatial correlation. Such responses are differentiable from responses to the {SMC} event and nonsubstorm times. We present a method to optimize network parametrization with respect to the different individual station responses, the spatial inhomogeneity of stations in the Northern Hemisphere, and the choice of correlation window sizes.

            The friendship paradox is the observation that the degrees of the neighbours of a node in any network will, on average, be greater than the degree of the node itself. In common parlance, your friends have more friends than you do. In this article, we develop the mathematical theory of the friendship paradox, both in general as well as for specific model networks, focusing not only on average behaviour but also on variation about the average and using generating function methods to calculate full distributions of quantities of interest. We compare the predictions of our theory with measurements on a large number of real-world network datasets and find remarkably good agreement. We also develop equivalent theory for the generalized friendship paradox, which compares characteristics of nodes other than degree to those of their neighbours.},

We used correlation and correlation distance matrices of Brazilian Representative votes during four presidential terms. Re-ordering these matrices with Minimal Spanning Trees displays the dynamical formation of clusters for the sixteen year period, which includes one Presidential impeachment. The reordered matrices, colored by correlation strength and by the parties clearly show the origin of observed clusters and their evolution over time. When large clusters provide government support cluster breaks, political instability arises, which could lead to an impeachment, a trend we observed three years before the Brazilian President was impeached.
